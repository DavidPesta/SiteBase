SiteBase
========

A simple framework of boilerplate code for quickly starting new PHP web projects.

<b>Initial Release:</b> May 26, 2012<br>

## Documentation

### Introduction

Here is what SiteBase gives you "out of the box" over starting with plain vanilla PHP:

- Project folder organization

- Separation of concerns for page-specific micro-MVC architectures

- Flexible controllers that can either serve an MVC page or an AJAX request

- Nested view layouts and page content

- A bootstrap to initialize configurations that serve both pages and AJAX requests

- An installation independent config file

- A "current" folder project update strategy

- A clean consistent webroot folder

- Keeps PHP code out of webroot for source code security

- Automatic error logging

- SEO-friendly URLs

- Consolidates CSS and JS files into single files to speed up page load times

- Easily auto-include new CSS and JS files by just adding them to the project

- Prevents CSS and JS changes from being cached via unique MD5 filename signatures

- Auto-compiles CoffeeScript and LESS files


### Setup

1. Create a /websites folder for all websites

2. Create a /websites/example.com folder for the example website

3. Place the config.php file into /websites/example.com/config.php

4. Place the contents of "current" into a /websites/example.com/YYYY-MM-DD folder where YYYY-MM-DD is the current date

5. Create a symbolic link called "current" that points to the /websites/example.com/YYYY-MM-DD folder
   - ln -sfn YYYY-MM-DD current

6. Configure /websites/example.com/current/webroot as the document root of the website

7. Use the following as your rewrite rule:

---

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^([\/\-?#A-Za-z0-9]*)$ router.php

---


### Updating

1. Create a new /websites/example.com/YYYY-MM-DD folder

2. Put all of your new scripts into that folder

3. Change the "current" symbolic link to the new folder
   - ln -sfn YYYY-MM-DD current


### Usage

- All scripts and images get organized inside of /websites/example.com/current/source

- Place images, .css, .js, .less, and .coffee files anywhere within the source folder and they will be automatically handled and placed in webroot
  - Their relative locations within webroot will be analogous to their relative locations within source
  - Site templates and CSS frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap, etc should all go into the source folder and it should work instantly

- Controllers are ordinary .php files
  - To use a controller for an AJAX request, just echo the response
  - To use a controller for a page, utilize the Page class in /websites/example.com/current/library/Page.php

- View files just contain HTML and PHP assisted markup and reside inside of phtml files

- Inside of a controller, utilize the Page class to coordinate the rendering of the view files for a page
  - Include the Page library: include LIBRARY . "/Page.php";
  - Create a new page object: $page = new Page();
  - Register view files with $page->addViewFiles and pass to it view names as keys and absolute view locations as values
  - Pass variables from the controller to the view like this: $page->var1 = "one";
  - Finally, the controller shall render the view: $page->show();

- Inside of view files (usually the layout), invoke the site's CSS file like this: /&lt;?= $this->_cssMd5 ?>.css

- Inside of view files (usually the layout), invoke the site's JS file like this: /&lt;?= $this->_jsMd5 ?>.js

- Inside of view files, you can invoke the webroot location analogous to the current view file like this: &lt;?= $this->folder() ?>

- Inside of view files, invoke the rendering of other registered view files like this: $this->content( "otherRegisteredView" )
  - You can have any number of nested view files with multiple nested layouts, etc

- Inside of view files, you can invoke variables passed to it from the controller: &lt;?= $var1 ?&gt; or &lt;? if( $var1 == true ): ?&gt;

- If PRODUCTION is "false" inside of the config.php file, then webroot will be cleared out of everything (except router.php) and replaced every page load
  - Every time you make a change to a .css, .js, .less, or .coffee file, the MD5 signature of the .js and .css file in the webroot gets changed

- The config.php file can hold installation specific configurations for anything you wish, allowing you to maintain different settings for production, demo, test, etc
  - This config.php file will not be affected by any project development updates if following the "Updating" protocol above

- The bootstrap.php is where you want to put configurations and setup that IS supposed to be applied to every install
  - Very useful constants that define locations all throughout the project reside here: ROOT, LIBRARY, SOURCE, WEBROOT, DATA, and ERRORS

- The /websites/example.com/current/library folder is where you want to keep all reusable library code

- Data that is needed for various system operations that isn't a good fit for the database can be organized into the /websites/example.com/current/data folder

- If the system encounters any errors, the /websites/example.com/current/errors folder will start getting populated with files

- There may be times when the order in which the JS or CSS files is important, which is when you put something like the following inside of the bootstrap:

---

    include LIBRARY . "/Page.php";
    Page::init([
      'cssOrder' => [
        '/test-page/styles/style.less',
        '/test-page/styles/style.css'
      ],
      'jsOrder' => [
        '/test-page/scripts/script.js',
        '/test-page/scripts/script.coffee'
      ]
    ]);

---

- You can put as many or as few of the files in there as you like. You don't have to put all (or any) of them in there, and the ones that you do put in there will be placed first before anything else.


### Best Practices

- Place favicon.ico inside of /source

- If a data file is needed by a library or some other system function, it is best to have the library check to make sure the data is present rather than just assume it exists
  - That way, the data folder does not need to exist in the product, but gets created when needed
  - if( ! is_dir( DATA . "/Page" ) ) mkdir( DATA . "/Page", 0777, true );

- If a data file is needed by a library, create a folder inside of the data folder with the name of the library, then put the data files for the use of that library in there

- If a controller needs to access the database and the SQL is rather trivial for a particular logical process, then just put the SQL in the controller. But if, for a logical process, the SQL is not trivial, there are multiple SQL calls involved, and/or there is data logic processing needed, that should be abstracted away into a separate model file that resides in the same folder as the page.

- If a model file has a method that needs to be used across two different pages, then you should make a common library out of it and organize it in the library folder
